Namespace Registration for Self Addressing Identifiers

Namespace Identifier:  said

Registrant: 


Purpose: 

Self-Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs) are a special type of content-addressable identifier based on an encoded cryptographic digest that is self-referential. This proposal defines a method to unambiguously identify digital assets via their SAID identifier with the creation of the urn:said: namespace. These URNs are non-resolvable, serving as unique identifiers. 

Syntax:

A `said` URN shall consist of two mandatory in the following order, with `:` characters between each section.
 
  - URN identifier (`urn:said`): REQUIRED

  - SAID, in string representation (as per Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) version 0.9, section 11.6 and represented with Base64URLSafe alphabet of RFC 4648). REQUIRED


The ABNF for a `said` URN is as follows:
*Chat GPT assisted ABNF - NEEDS HELP FROM COMMUNITY:*
said-urn = "urn:said:" said-digest
said-digest = 43*86base64url-char
              ; typically 256-bit digests (e.g., SHA-256) are 43-char base64url
              ; higher sizes like SHA-512 would be longer
base64url-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_"
ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A ; A-Z / a-z
DIGIT = %x30-39           ; 0-9

EXAMPLES:

  - `urn:said:HH9Zeft48ILoscZ2Y124eVxKxvq6A1JftwjLX9aP1Axe`
  - `urn:said:EGHMmOQt7ZaAeAa_FiDhPE5qG4UGjK2TOCouMQfCaa7-`


Assignment: 

URNs conforming to this scheme are self-assigned, based on the derivation of the SAID (as per CESR version 0.9) described at: https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#self-addressing-identifier-said

Security and Privacy: 

No known security or privacy issues exist for this URN namespace.

Interoperability: 

No known concerns or requirements around interoperability exist.

Resolution:

These URNs are non-resolvable and serve as globally unique identifiers.
